## Defines the list of labels to apply to a PR when there is a change in a specified path
# the default label is applied to all the PRs, other labels will filter based on the files changed on the PR.
# follows the same pattern as reviewers.yml.
# here also we don't support glob patterns for now, but we'll try to get there soon.
# please see the example for the file below
